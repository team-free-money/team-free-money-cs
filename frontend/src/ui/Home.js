                            Travel time to the nearest starbase? I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your
                            judgement. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? About four years. I got tired of
                            hearing how young I looked. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone
                            Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? And blowing into
                            maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Shields up! Rrrrred
